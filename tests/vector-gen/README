This directory contains a very simple implementation of the Noise
protocol independent of that in the library's SymmetricState and
HandshakeState objects.  It is used to cross-check the smarter
versions in the library.

We assume that the CipherState, DHState, and HashState implementations
in the library work correctly as basic low-level primitives.

This simple implementation is not very efficient, is not very strict
about checking buffer lengths, and has a limited packet size.  It is not
recommended for any purpose except offline generation of test vectors.
